Part :one: : Add to persistent storage with the _fs_ Node core module. You can save a JSON in a file

Part :two: (recommended but not mandatory) Try to add a set of query params for filter the results (or search). For example the pathname */cars?brand="f"* should return all the cars which has the brand name starting with _f_ . Try to add color and model as well.

Have a read about queryparams here: https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query
