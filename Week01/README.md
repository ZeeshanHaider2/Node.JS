### There are 2 challenges:
*1)* The first challenge is to find how many times a word is found in  4 different documents. So you need to read 4 files and find how many times a word is repeated in those 4 files, as fast as possible and as short as possible. 

Bonus point: Try to see how much time it will take to run your code.

*2)* Repeat the challenge without using any async code and see how fast it is i.e.compare the time difference with the async code.
